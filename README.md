## What is this?
* This is a free pitch (no initial tuning system) piano roll.  
* The scale zone mechanism and analytics based on harmonic entropy, categorical entropy and short-term pitch memory model allow you to create melodies without knowledge of traditional music theory.
* Instead of composing in a pre-selected scale, scale is created in parallel with the creation of the melody. Scale zones can flow into each other.
